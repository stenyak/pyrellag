Pyrellag
========

Description
-----------

Pyrellag is a very simple, fast, low-overhead **media gallery viewer**, suitable for huge collections of media.

For reference, it's able to scan from scratch a 7GB collection of photos/videos in under 2 minutes.

This software is released under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. Please see `LICENSE` file for more information.

Main features
-------------

 - View all your videos and images **from the browser**.
 - **Touch interface** friendly (tablets, cellphones) and poweruser-friendly (key shortcuts).
 - Choose between **public gallery** or **private gallery**:
   - Authentication via OpenID (Google, Yahoo, Flickr...).
   - Authorization via simple user groups, on a folder-by-folder basis.
 - Extract and run! No need to set up external databases.
 - No need to "upload", "register" or move your photos anywhere: just tell Pyrellag where in the disk your stuff is, and off you go!

Instructions
------------

Quick set up:
 1. Create a directory named `data`, and put all your media directories there (symlink is fine too).
 2. Install the required dependencies: `$ ./get_libs.sh`
 3. Run the gallery server: `$ ./pyrellag.py`

Open the resulting URL in your browser. **The first user that registers will get administrator rights**.


Offline thumbnails generation (this is optional, only if you want to manually trigger the update of all thumbnails):
 - Run `$ ./scan_gallery.py`


Configuration
-------------

You can edit the configuration file (`config.json`) either directly on your filesystem, or using the "configuration" link near your username (you must be administrator for the link to show).

 - `debug_mode_enabled`: only set to `true` if you are a programmer and are working on Pyrellag source.
 - `follow_freedesktop_standard`: if set to `true`, thumbnails generated by Purellag will be usable by other apps. If set to `false`, you can instead be free to move your gallery around the harddisk without needing to regenerate the thumbnails each time.
 - `profile_creation_enabled`: allow or disallow creation of new user profiles (won't delete nor disable existing profiles).
 - `public_access` : if `true`, anybody can view the whole gallery. If `false`, authorization is needed everywhere.

Authorization
-------------

**By default**, your Pyrellag gallery will be **publicly viewable** by anybody.

If you need privacy, you may want to limit who can view which galleries.

To this end, Pyrellag implements a **group-based authorization** system: you can define who belongs to each group, and which groups can view each directory:

 1. Log in as the administrator user (first user ever registered).
 2. Disable `public_access` in the configuration (top-right link).
 3. Create a file named `.access` in each directory of your gallery, and write which groups can view the contents(\*). If no `.access` file exists, that directory won't be accessible.
 4. Finally, open the profiles editor (top-right link), and fill the user groups that each profile belongs to.

(\*) Example: to only allow family and friends groups to view your vacations photos, write this to the `data/photos/vacations/.access` file:

    family
    friends


That's it. Now only authorized users will be able to see stuff, always according to the groups they belong to.


ToDo
----

Some stuff I'd like to do in the future:
 - Use an animated gif with select frames for video thumbnails.
